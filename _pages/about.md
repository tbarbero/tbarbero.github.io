Hi there! I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University advised by Prof. Michael Bell. I completed my MS in Atmospheric Science in 2023 and my BS in Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the University of California San Diego in 2020.

I use a combination of observations, idealized models, and theory to investigate topics in tropical atmospheric dynamics. I'm also passionate about teaching, mentoring, and practicing science communication. I hope to inspire, in others, the same enthusiasm I have for the atmosphere. Thanks for visiting my page!

This page is still under construction :)
