Hi there! I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University advised by Prof. Michael Bell. I completed my MS in Atmospheric Science in 2023 and my BS in Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and the University of California San Diego in 2020.
